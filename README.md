### buy-vs-rent

- [ ] Cross validate using other buy - rent model (like [this one](https://my.causal.app/models/191997/edit) for example)
- [ ] Is it fair to compare the rent and buy scenarios, given that in the buy scenario we are asking for a credit (which obviously increases the implicit budget) and in the rent scenario we are not?

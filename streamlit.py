    This is an attempt to model the financial decision of renting vs buying a house according to a set of configurable parameters. The goal is to produce two plots

    * Net worth of an individual that decided to rent over the next 30 years
    * Net worth of an individual that decided to buy over the next 30 years

    The net worth of an individual who rents is calculated as
    ```
    (the net amount they can sell their investments for at a point in time)
        - (the accumulated expenses on the renting scenario)
    ```

    The net worth of an individual who buys a house is calculated as
    ```
    (the net amount they can sell the house for at a point in time) 
        - (the amount that is remaining on the mortgage) 
        - (the accumulated expenses on the renting scenario)
        + (the capital gains on the exceeding budget)
